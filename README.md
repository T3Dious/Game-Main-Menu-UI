# Game-Main-Menu-UI
Before anything you will need the script in the link below when you use it 
https://github.com/T3Dious/GameManager/blob/main/GameManager.cs

the script is too simple from its name a mainmenu that you see in any game when you open, but this one am trying to make it more advanced like using json file to save the progess when you start the game and then you exit the game and trying to continue what you have acheived as that one is here for now and soon will upload options script once iam be sure that will be working in other game.

Note: for this one am using new unity ui builder in Unity6 in case that you are using older version just remove the entity in start function that it will be fine ^^!
